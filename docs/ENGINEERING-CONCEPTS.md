# Engineering concepts, each paired with a mechanism

**A concept with no mechanism beside it is vocabulary.** Every entry below names the concept, then the
thing that actually implements it — or states plainly that nothing does yet. That second column is the
point; the definitions are available everywhere.

Ordered by leverage: **prevention first, detection last.**

---

## I. Structural prevention — the fault cannot be expressed

The highest-leverage tier. A fault that cannot be represented needs no guard, no healer and no retry.

| concept | mechanism that implements it |
|---|---|
| **Make illegal states unrepresentable** | A port registry whose `match` field names the *binary*, not one of its roles. Declaring `opencode` instead of `opencode-chat` ended a recurring "collision" that was a program using its own port — the fault became inexpressible instead of detectable. |
| **Poka-Yoke (mistake-proofing)** | A safe route that is *structurally incapable*, never flagged safe: it loads no key and takes no nonce, so there is nothing to set wrongly. |
| **Parse, don't validate** | Config candidates are parsed and applied through one gate that restarts the app and reads the app's **own** loader verdict, then reverts. Validity is decided at the boundary, once. |
| **Design by Contract** | An exit code is the contract between two scripts. Replacing `grep -q '<a log sentence>'` with `exit 3` removed an implicit interface that a reworded log line would have silently broken. |
| **Total functions** | A resolver that always answers: the authoritative path, or an explicit refusal. Never silence. **Absent is not zero.** |
| **Pure zero-defects (eliminate recovery paths)** | Removing `npx -y` from a wrapper deleted the cache that grew 328 MB per invocation. No rotation policy can beat deleting the writer. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |

## II. Determinism and reproducibility

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Idempotency** | Generators write only when content actually changed, comparing with the timestamp line masked. Idempotent in *effect* is not enough — judge a generator on its **diff**. |
| **Deterministic serialization** | The same masked comparison: byte-identical output for identical input, so version control stays quiet and caching is trivial. |
| **Hermeticity** | Every wrapper sets `PATH` explicitly and preflights its binary, because GUI-launched processes inherit a stub environment — no profile, no keys. One agent was invisible for a month for exactly this. |
| **Provenance** | **GAP.** Knowledge files do not record which agent wrote them. Named as a failure mode in the literature ("provenance collapse") and not yet closed here. |

## III. Decoupling

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Orthogonality** | No detector may invoke another detector. One leaked process once lit three of them and read as three problems. **A cascade is one fault, not N.** An aggregate is permitted only if it declares itself one. |
| **Law of Demeter** | Same rule, stated as coupling: a checker that reaches through another checker cannot fail independently. |
| **Composability** | One dispatcher, one door: `<tool> <agent> "<task>" <cwd>`. Every agent is reachable the same way, so pipelines compose without special cases. |
| **Abstraction / polymorphism** | One route parameter instead of two implementations. Two code paths for "safe" and "real" drift until a fudge factor is needed to reconcile them — that number is the cost of having two. |

## IV. Observability — and its limits

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Observability** | Every check prints the **count it resolved** and its **own blind spot**, every run. A silent clean pass and a silent empty pass must never look identical. |
| **Grounding** | Verify against the shipped instrument — the binary's own symbol table, `lsof`, `ps`, `--porcelain` — never against documentation. Every wrong verdict in one measured day came from docs or memory; every verdict that held came from an instrument. |
| **Cybernetics (self-regulating loops)** | Budgets are **ratchets**: they only move down, and raising one must name what was added and why. A threshold that drifts upward silently is not a bound. |
| **Shadow validation** | A new check must (1) fail on a planted defect and (2) sweep the entire existing tree clean before it is trusted. Sensitivity proves nothing about specificity. |
| **Contextual drift** | Always-loaded instructions are metered and budgeted separately from lazily-loaded bodies. A description is paid on every request; a body is not. **An unused cluster is a subscription.** |

## V. Minimalism

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Parsimony (Occam's razor)** | The ladder, in order: needed at all? → already present? → standard library? → platform? → installed dependency? → one line? → only then the minimum new thing. |
| **Tree-shaking / dead-code elimination** | A symbol is private until a second module imports it. Exporting "in case" produced 30 unimported exports in one audit; one of them was a refuted implementation still callable — not dead code, a **trap**. |
| **Idling eviction** | Load reference material on demand through a routing table rather than preloading it. One router replaced fifteen always-on descriptions: the cost went from ~595 tokens per request to ~42. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Payload minimalization** | Read version control terse: `--porcelain`, `--oneline`, `--stat` then a named path. Measured on one repository, same information: **94,247 B → 6,116 B**. |

## VI. Detection — the last resort

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Heuristic hardening** | A check that fires on correct input gets switched off, and a switched-off check catches nothing. Prefer a **false pass** to a false alarm, and declare which way it is biased. |
| **Verifiability** | Judge on the **exit code**, never a line of output. One harness printed "54/54 pass" over seven real failures. |
| **Hyrum's Law** | Assume every observable behaviour will be depended on. Publish exit codes as interfaces; treat log prose as private. |
| **Wirth's Law** | A check too slow to run does not run. One sweep of 44 patterns over 811 files exceeded its timeout; a single alternation pass gave the same answer in 11 s. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |

---


## VII. Decay — the system rots while the code stands still

Nothing in this tier is about writing code badly. It is about correct code becoming wrong because the
world around it moved.

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bit rot / software entropy** | Measured instance: a package manager's script policy permitted exactly one package, so four *unchanged* CLIs silently became stub binaries — correct code, changed environment, a misleading error. The check verifies the file the launcher points at is a program, not that the package is "installed". |
| **Epitaph-driven design (self-expiring code)** | An explicit registry of everything paused, disabled or deferred, each row carrying a `review_by` date and the exact command that settles it. A check **fails** once a date passes. Two ways to settle: re-test and bump, or delete the thing and remove the row. "Leave it and look away" is not one of them. Before this existed, six things were paused in one day and **none** had an expiry. |
| **Zimmerman's Law of tech-debt decay** | The same registry carries the security rows — exposed credentials awaiting rotation — with the nearest dates, because a stale dependency that survives long enough becomes an attack surface through transitive sub-dependencies. |
| **Architectural drift** | A machine-readable registry of what exists, validated against reality **in both directions**: every declared thing must be present, *and* every present thing must be declared. The reverse direction is the one that catches something added through a UI and recorded nowhere. |
| **Code sclerosis** | The tell is measurable: count how often each check fails. One that fails repeatedly is reporting on its own cause or on itself. Chase the repeat count before adding another check. |
| **Deprecation friction** | Keep the old route runnable behind a declared switch, or every prior measurement loses its baseline. A paused thing is *wired and out of quota*, never deleted — and it carries a review date so "paused" cannot quietly mean "gone". |
| **Strangler fig** | Replace an implementation and **delete the old one in the same commit**. A superseded implementation left exported is not dead code, it is a trap: the next reader takes the obvious name. |
| **Continuous garbage collection of code** | Checks for dead imports, unreachable modules and unimported exports, with the bar set at *declaration-only* — the looser "not imported" rule flagged 30 symbols and was wrong about 26, which would have forced an exemption list, and an exemption list is a silenced check. |
| **Lehman's Law of continuing change** | Complexity grows unless work is done to reduce it. The counter-pressure here is a **ratchet**: the always-loaded instruction budget only moves down, and raising it must name what was added and why it must be read every session. |
| **Hyrum's Law in reverse (erosion of guarantees)** | Upgrades break consumers who depended on old *behaviour*, not the contract. Hence: publish exit codes as the interface and treat log prose as private — a lesson learned by depending on my own log sentence within hours of writing it. |

---


## VIII. Agent protocol, telemetry and durable state

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Dynamic capability discovery** | Ask the agent what it can do instead of assuming. Each agent was made to enumerate its own callable tools, and they differed enormously — one carried ~25 web-research tools, another carried persistent memory and delegation. **Routing by measured capability beats routing by reputation.** |
| **JSON-RPC 2.0 framing over stdio** | The probe speaks the protocol directly: `initialize` → `session/new(cwd)` → `session/prompt`, and answers the agent's own callbacks. An agent waiting on its client is indistinguishable from a broken one unless you answer it. |
| **Sampling (nested invocations)** | An orchestrator that can delegate: one door, `<tool> <agent> "<task>" <cwd>`, with a per-agent lock so two callers never double-spend one credential. |
| **Agentic telemetry** | Every run appends to a ledger — agent, exit code, duration, working directory — so a sibling process can see what was spent without reading logs. A verdict store, not a log file. |
| **Headless process introspection** | Check the process table, not console output. The invariant: **an agent process may exist only while a lock is held for it.** Three were found alive 6–17 minutes past their runs, and one held a port declared to another service. |
| **Durable state machine execution** | State is written to a file at every transition, and a resolver answers *which* file is authoritative for a given directory — never assumed. It refuses rather than printing nothing when the declared file is absent. |
| **Reconciliation loop (desired state)** | A registry declares what should exist; a check compares it to reality **in both directions**. The reverse direction is the one that catches something added through a UI and recorded nowhere. |
| **Contextual checkpointing** | Session state is compressed into a capped, overwritten file — not an append-only history. A 13,000-character "current state" file is a blob in the one place read first. |
| **Resource URI subscriptions** | **GAP.** Everything here polls. Nothing subscribes, so a context change reaches an agent only when something asks. |

**The protocol lesson that cost the most:** an exit code is an interface, log prose is not. A retry that
keyed on another script's log sentence would have broken silently the moment that sentence was reworded.

---


## IX. File topology, navigation and defect-prevention placement

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Screaming architecture** | The knowledge store is filed **by the SHAPE of the lesson** — `measurement/`, `silent-failure/`, `guard-design/` — never by subject. Filing by subject put 306 of 544 files in one bucket; the shape is what a future reader searches by. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Bounded context (max depth 3–4)** | Measured: knowledge store depth **3**, scripts **2**, hub **1**. The one place reaching **6** is a deliberately archived misnamed copy, correctly parked — depth is a smell, not a law, and an archive is allowed to be deep. |
| **Colocation** | **PARTIAL.** Each check carries its rationale, its blind spot and its failure history in its own docblock, so the reasoning travels with the code. But its mutation tests live in commit history, not beside it — a real gap. |
| **Barrel exports / index sanitization** | Generated folder indexes act as the public face of a directory; the generator refuses to rewrite one whose content has not changed, so the index never churns. |
| **AST indexing** | Semantic search over an indexed corpus is reached for **before** any text search. Text search is the fallback, not the default — regex over source is how you miss a symbol. |
| **Software archeology** | Churn is the map: `git log --name-only` over one day named the hot spots exactly — the guard roster (9 edits), the ACP probe (6), the dispatcher (5). **What changes most is what needs the best docblock.** |
| **Shift-left verification** | Checks moved from manual → wired into an existing 4-hourly job → cheap enough to run per-change. The next shift left is edit-time, and it is not done. |
| **Sub-tool orchestration (meta-tools)** | One dispatcher fronting every agent, with a per-agent lock, a run ledger and an exit-code contract — so a caller composes one door instead of N. |
| **Custom key-namespace** | A cache keyed on `path + mtime + size`: the key IS the correctness argument, because any edit must change it. Verified by editing a cached file and confirming the re-scan. |
| **Idempotency-key store** | The same principle applied to a lock: a per-agent lock directory holding its owner's PID, with a dead holder announced as STALE rather than silently stolen. |
| **Typestate** | **WEAK here.** The nearest thing is an exit code that means "no answer, but tools ran", which callers branch on. Real typestate would make the invalid call unrepresentable rather than merely detectable. |
| **Signature authentication guard** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — nothing here ingests third-party webhooks. Recorded so its absence is a decision, not an oversight. |

---


## X. Calculation and throughput

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Memoization / dynamic programming** | The prose check caches per file on `path + mtime + size`. It did not merely speed up the old job — it made the roster affordable to **triple**, from 814 files to 2,504, which immediately surfaced findings that had been invisible. **A cache's real payoff is often a bigger job, not a faster one.** *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Closed-form expression** | Prefer one pass with an alternation over N passes per pattern: 44 patterns × 811 files was ~35,000 processes and blew a timeout; one alternation gave the same answer in seconds. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Algorithmic parsimony** | Choose the threshold the defect demands, not the strictest one available. A duplicate-line check at 9 characters flagged status logs; at 60 characters it flags duplicated prose and nothing else. |
| **Vectorization (SIMD)** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — no numeric hot loop here. Recorded so its absence is a decision. |
| **Zero-copy memory access** | Pass a path, not a payload. Checks read files in place rather than shipping contents between processes; the closest violation was piping an 11 MB string into `grep`, which broke on SIGPIPE. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Backpressure handling** | Per-agent locks that **fail closed** (exit 3) rather than queueing. One process backing off does nothing if its siblings do not, so the throttle is published where siblings read it. |
| **Event-driven / non-blocking** | **PARTIAL.** Agent probes are async over stdio and answer callbacks mid-stream. Everything else polls. |
| **Binary protocol serialization** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — JSON-RPC over stdio is the protocol, and its cost is not the bottleneck. |
| **Zero-overhead abstractions** | A wrapper must add environment and preflight, then `exec` — replacing itself, not wrapping a child. That is what makes process-group cleanup work at all. |

## XI. Instantaneous execution and agent-to-agent

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **AOT (ahead-of-time) pre-linking — kill cold starts** | Packages are **installed and pinned**, never `npx -y`-ed per launch. That removed a cache that grew 328 MB per invocation *and* made every agent start faster. Cold-start cost and cache growth were the same defect. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Zero-latency invocation** | Local first, always: a `$0` local router and a local model before any hosted call. The rung below must be proven unable before the next one is used. |
| **JIT (just-in-time) compilation** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — nothing here compiles at runtime. |
| **A2A interoperability** | ACP over JSON-RPC is the protocol; agents are addressed by a declared **agent id**, and a registry is validated against reality in both directions so an id cannot exist in only one place. |
| **In-memory event bus (pub/sub)** | **GAP.** State is passed through files and a run ledger — durable and inspectable, but polled. Nothing subscribes. |
| **Semantic linkage (code-graph)** | Semantic search over an index is the first move for any symbol question; text search is the fallback. |
| **Inlining** | Applied to prose, not code: a pointer beats a copy. The same explanation lived in three files and the next correction had to land in each. |
| **Symbolic references** | Paths are globbed or derived, never pinned: a registry-cached binary is found by `sort -V | tail -1`, and a lazily-loaded skill resolves its versioned directory at call time. A pinned version is a future break. |
| **Macros / metaprogramming** | Generators, not templates: indexes, rosters and project state are produced from the tree, so they cannot disagree with it. |

## XII. Verification methods not yet used

Recorded because naming a method you are **not** using is more honest than implying coverage.

| concept | status here |
|---|---|
| **Property-based testing** | **GAP.** Every check is mutation-tested against *hand-planted* defects. A generator would explore inputs I did not think of — and my hand-written tests were wrong three times today (a window smaller than the defect; a threshold below the planted value; a file outside the roster). |
| **Symbolic execution** | **NOT USED.** Shell and small scripts; the cost would exceed the benefit. |
| **Time-travel debugging** | **PARTIALLY COVERED** by append-only ledgers — guard verdicts, agent runs, heal actions — which reconstruct what happened, though not variable state. |
| **Continuous AST linting** | **NOT REACHED.** Checks run on demand and on a schedule. Edit-time is the next shift left and is not done. |
| **Correctness-by-construction** | **ASPIRATION.** The nearest real instance: a config is never edited in place — a candidate is applied through a gate that reads the app's own loader verdict and reverts. |
| **Static invariant verification** | **PARTIAL.** Invariants are asserted at runtime and printed (counts, roster sizes, blind spots) rather than proven statically. |
| **Linear / affine types** | **NOT AVAILABLE** in shell. The substitute is a lock with an owner PID plus an `EXIT` trap — resource discipline by convention, enforced by a check rather than a compiler. |

## XIII. Interface, output and governance

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Schema enforcement (data contracts)** | Registries are TSV with a declared header and a validator that fails on a malformed row — including a date field that is not a date, because an un-expirable expiry is the whole failure mode. |
| **Single source of truth** | One declaration per fact, everything else generated or validated against it: agents, ports, epitaphs, budgets. The recurring defect all day was two copies of one fact. |
| **Declarative pipelines** | A registry declares the desired state; a check reconciles it against reality and reports the delta. |
| **Hot module replacement** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — but its spirit is honoured: apply, verify against the app's own verdict, revert on rejection, never require a manual restart to know. |
| **Dynamic dispatch** | One dispatcher resolves an agent id to a wrapper at call time. Adding an agent is a registry row, not a code change. |
| **Content-addressable routing** | The cache key is content-derived (`mtime + size`); an edit cannot hit a stale entry. |
| **Stateless monads** | **NOT APPLICABLE** in shell. The intent survives as: a check reads, computes, prints and exits — it never mutates what it inspects. `selfheal` is the one writer, and it refuses judgement faults. |
| **Progressive disclosure** | The load-bearing token discipline: a lazy body costs nothing until invoked, a description is paid every request. One router replaced fifteen always-on descriptions — ~595 tokens per request down to ~42. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Affordance-driven design** | One key prefix for the whole agent surface, numbered 1–9, because a keystroke the OS silently swallows is worse than none. |
| **Optimistic UI / micro-frontend** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — no UI is authored here. |
| **Syntactic sanitization** | Config candidates are parsed before they are applied, and a comment-tolerant parse is used where the format allows comments — a strict parser that rejects legal input is a check that gets switched off. |
| **Zero-dependency engineering** | The ladder starts at "needed at all?" and ends at "only then the minimum". A third-party dependency added a 207 MB cache this system cannot bound, because its config is overwritten by a sync. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Ingest-first queueing · idempotency key store · signature auth** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — nothing here receives third-party webhooks. The lock registry is the nearest analogue of an idempotency key. |
| **Dependency graph visualization** | **GAP.** Coupling was found by reading a file, not a graph — one check invoked another and lit three at once. A graph would have shown it immediately. |
| **Alignment** | The operating contract is explicit and its rules carry measurements, so a claim can be checked against an instrument rather than a preference. Every verdict is labelled CONFIRMED, REPORTED, INFERRED or UNCERTAIN. |
| **Conway's Law** | One person, one machine — so the architecture mirrors a single operator: one hub, one dispatcher, one store, many entry points. |
| **Postel's Law** | Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you emit: parse comment-tolerant config, but publish exit codes as the contract and treat log prose as private. |

---


## XIV. Failure classification, polyglot parity, and parallel work

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Boundary type-guarding (reject at the edge)** | A config candidate is parsed before it is applied, and applied through one gate that reads the application's own loader verdict. Validity is decided once, at the boundary — never rechecked deep inside. |
| **Method-matching precision (405, not a generic catch-all)** | The equivalent for a command surface: an action bound to a key must exist **and** be buildable. A binding that names a real action but passes no required argument loads fine and never fires — that is the local `405`, and it was live for hours while a check reported "all actions exist". |
| **Idempotent state idling (409 prevention)** | Per-agent locks holding an owner PID: a second caller is **refused**, not queued, and a dead holder is announced as STALE rather than silently stolen. Optimistic concurrency, enforced by a directory. |
| **Circuit breaking (502/503/504 isolation)** | Distinguish the codes: a rate-limit says *slow down and retry*, a payment-required says *the budget is gone and every retry is waste*. **Latch on the second, never the first.** Applied to agents: a quota refusal is not retried; a deadline is. |
| **Contract-driven schema generation (anti-drift)** | One declaration per fact, everything else generated from or validated against it — agents, ports, epitaphs, budgets, rosters. Every recurring defect in one measured day was two copies of one fact. |
| **AST-driven cross-language parity** | The polyglot substrate is a routing atlas: one route per language pack, each with a guide, an operating card and a machine-readable tool manifest, resolved by routing a file rather than guessing an idiom. |
| **FFI boundary encapsulation** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — no native bindings here. Its spirit survives as: cross a boundary once, with the environment made explicit, then `exec` rather than wrap. |
| **Atomic design hierarchy** | Applied to knowledge rather than components: a fact, a file, a shape-bucket, a store, an index. Filing by SHAPE rather than subject is what keeps the hierarchy usable — by subject, 306 of 544 files landed in one bucket. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **State-driven determinism (UI = f(state))** | Generated artifacts are a pure function of the tree: indexes, project state and rosters are derived, and the generator refuses to rewrite output whose content has not changed. |
| **CSS-in-JS zero-runtime extraction** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — no authored UI. The analogue that does apply: move work to generation time, so the read path stays cheap. |
| **Reactive push-pull backpressure** | A bounded declaration plus a consumer that refuses when saturated: locks fail closed, budgets are ratchets, and a dead lane is distinguished from a throttled one by a two-stage probe. |
| **Transactional outbox (dual-write consistency)** | The nearest real instance: salvage **before** removal. A worktree held the only copy of a line; it was extracted and committed in its own commit *before* anything was deleted. **Never let the destructive step and the preserving step share a failure mode.** |
| **Short-circuit middleware ordering** | Cheapest check first, always: a name match before a process probe, a cached verdict before a file read, a local `$0` model before a hosted call. The ladder is the middleware order. |
| **Git worktree isolation** | Real, and its failure modes are now guarded: a worktree NESTED inside its own repo (invisible to status, indexed as content), PHANTOM (registered path gone), FINISHED (`ahead=0`, clean), DORMANT (no commit in 21 days). One repo held three copies of itself — 43% of a store *(measured at v1.1.0)*. |
| **Modular monolith ("worktree arms")** | The rule that keeps it honest: **the repository's own path is the main worktree, never a lane.** Lanes merge to the default branch only, and `branch -d` refusing IS the guard — it only deletes a fully merged branch. |
| **Pluggable extension architecture (micro-kernel)** | A tiny core plus declared extensions: one dispatcher resolving an agent id to a wrapper at call time, so adding an agent is a registry row rather than a code change. Each wrapper owns its own environment and preflight. |

**The classification lesson underneath this tier:** an error code is only useful if the caller branches
differently on it. A retry that treats "out of budget" and "try again" identically will burn the budget
proving the difference.

## XV. Advanced laws — where they bind, and where they do not

Two of these describe things done here before they were named. Several do not apply at one machine and
one operator, and saying so is more useful than pretending coverage.

| law | how it binds here |
|---|---|
| **Semantic idempotency** (agentic side-effect law) | **THE sharpest one.** Byte-identical idempotency is meaningless for a stochastic agent: two different wordings must still produce ONE downstream state change. The dispatcher has a per-agent **lock**, which prevents *concurrency* — it does **not** prevent a second invocation repeating a side effect. That is a real, named gap: there is no idempotency key on a delegated task. |
| **Algorithmic information decay** (Chaitin-Kolmogorov drift) | Applied today without the name: every agent claim was re-verified against the **raw instrument** — the binary's symbol table, `lsof`, `ps`, `--porcelain` — never against another agent's summary. One agent proposed two settings already configured because it read docs; another proposed routing it already had. **Re-anchor each step to the root source, never to the previous agent's output.** |
| **Gall-Hoare invariant** | *A complex system that works was derived from a simple system that worked.* A fair criticism of building twenty checks in a day. What keeps it honest: each one is mutation-tested individually and composes only through one ledger, so the system is twenty simple things plus an index — not one designed-up-front whole. Worth re-reading whenever a twenty-first is proposed. |
| **Abstraction-defect correlation** (every abstraction leaks) | Honoured by escape hatches: a dispatcher that exposes the underlying wrapper path, a probe that can print the agent's private reasoning on request, a lazily-routed reference that names the exact file to read. **The leak found today: a retry keyed on another script's log prose — the abstraction hid that the interface was a sentence.** |
| **PACELC** | The real trade is Latency vs Consistency with no partition in sight. The memoised prose check chose latency: it trusts `path + mtime + size` rather than re-reading. The key IS the consistency argument, and it was tested by editing a cached file. |
| **Linearizable consistency boundary** | **PARTIAL.** A lock directory with an owner PID gives mutual exclusion, not linearizability. Honest scope: one machine, one operator, no distributed ordering requirement. |
| **Anti-entropy gossip convergence** | **NOT APPLICABLE.** One machine. The analogue that does apply: publish state where siblings *read* it — a run ledger, a lock directory, a guard ledger — rather than each process holding a private view. |
| **Continuous attestation** (zero-trust execution) | **NOT APPLICABLE** at this scale, but its weak form is enforced: verify capability, never identity. A health `200` is not identity; a package being "installed" is not a working binary; an action *existing* is not an action being *buildable*. |
| **Amdahl-Gustafson duality** | Measured the other way: fan-out cost ~15x tokens vs a chat, and token use explains ~80% of performance variance *(measured at v1.1.0)*. So added capacity should buy **deeper verification**, not more parallel opinions — five agents asked for opinions produced one good answer, one useless one, and one needing the prompt rewritten. |
| **Semantic type enclosure** (types as proofs) | **NOT AVAILABLE** in shell. The substitute is a validated registry: a row whose `review_by` is not a date is rejected, because an un-expirable expiry is the whole failure mode. Validation at the boundary, since the type system cannot carry the proof. |

**The one that should change behaviour tomorrow:** semantic idempotency. A delegated task has no
idempotency key, so a repeated delegation repeats its side effects. The lock makes that *unlikely*, not
*impossible* — and "unlikely" is the word that precedes every incident report.

---

## XV-a. Anti-break — prevent the break, then make silence impossible

**The expensive break is not the loud one. It is the one whose output is identical to success.**
Everything below was found on one machine; each row names the sighting, then the mechanism that
makes that shape unrepresentable rather than merely detectable.

### Tier 0 — the break cannot be expressed

The only tier that scales. A fault that cannot be represented needs no guard, no retry and no alert.

| the break | why it was silent | the mechanism that removes it |
|---|---|---|
| A mutation fixture hard-typed `1.1.0` while `VERSION` moved to `1.2.0`. It indented a line the check no longer read — **the case went green while planting nothing.** | A passing test and a test that tested nothing print the same word: `ok`. | **DERIVE, NEVER TYPE.** The fixture reads `VERSION`. One number, one declaration; a second copy goes stale the first time either is edited. |
| A rate-limit latch assigned `latched_until = ?`, so a 429 rewrote a 402's day-long latch down to 60 s. | Both are "a latch was set". Nothing distinguishes forward from backward. | **A MONOTONIC WRITE.** `MAX(latched_until, excluded.latched_until)` — the latch is structurally incapable of moving backward, so no caller can get the order wrong. |
| A safe/paper route that merely *sets a flag* can be flipped by any caller. | The flag and the real route share one code path. | **STRUCTURAL INCAPABILITY.** The safe route loads no key and takes no nonce. There is nothing to set wrongly. |

### Tier 1 — the break can happen, but it cannot be silent

When tier 0 is unavailable, the requirement is exact: **the failure output must differ from the
success output, and the exit code must differ too.** Either alone has been observed to fail.

| the break | how it stayed silent | the mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `if (!j.choices) return false` treated an aggregator's `{"error":{…503…}}` inside an HTTP 200 as a valid answer. Six chain members were never tried. | The status said 200. The router branched on the status; the body held the failure. | **BRANCH ON THE BODY, NEVER THE STATUS.** The status is the aggregator's rendering; the body is the identity. |
| `make status` printed `0/12 loaded` and **exited 0**, because its only roster guard was called with `\|\| true`. | The verdict was computed and thrown away. | **NEVER DISCARD AN EXIT CODE.** Assert the exit code in the test, not the presence of the command in the Makefile. |
| An overfitting guard correctly refused a malformed row; three of five callers wrapped it in `except Exception: pass`. | The refusal existed and reached nobody. | **A GUARD'S REFUSAL IS OUTPUT.** Catch the specific exception and print it; never bare-pass a guard. |
| `pytest scripts/atlas_test.py` reports "no tests ran" and **exits 0**. | Zero tests and all tests passing are the same exit code. | **ASSERT THE COUNT, NOT THE PASS.** The harness prints `24/24` and asserts its own case count. |
| A guard suite printed a clean sweep whether it had checked 19 files or 0. | A silent clean pass and a silent empty pass are the same output. | **PRINT WHAT IT RESOLVED TO, EVERY RUN**, and assert it against something independent. *(measured at v1.2.0)* |
| A backup reported `Repository not found` for a live repo for weeks. | A 404 renders "gone" and "this identity cannot see it" identically. | **NAME THE IDENTITY IN THE FAILURE.** Print which credential was refused, not just what was missing. |

### Tier 2 — detect, and only then

A detector nobody runs is a record of what went wrong, not prevention. Two rules keep this tier honest:

- **Mutation-test every detector both ways.** Sensitivity — plant the defect, assert it fails. Specificity — sweep the whole real tree, zero findings, or every finding justified at the exemption. *Mutation testing proves sensitivity and says nothing about specificity*, and the reaction to a noisy guard is never to fix it, it is to silence it.
- **An exemption is a behaviour change.** It invalidates the test that asserted the old behaviour, and that test's next failure will be read as the guard being broken. Update the test in the same commit, and give the exemption its own case — the exemption that disarms a test is usually itself untested.

### The ordering, stated once

**Can the break be made unrepresentable? → Can it be made impossible to be silent? → Only then, detect it.**
A check added at tier 2 for a fault that tier 0 could have deleted is work that must be maintained forever.

**The tell that you are at the wrong tier:** the fix you are writing is a fudge factor reconciling
two code paths, an exemption list, or a retry. All three say the shape should have been removed
one tier up.

## XV-b. The classical laws — the five that were missing, and the eight already here

A 14-law set was proposed for harvest at v1.2.0. **Eight were already in this document** —
Goodhart, Conway, Hyrum, Demeter, Gall, Postel, the Rule of Three and the Law of Least Knowledge —
so adding them would have been duplication, which is the cheapest thing to add and the worst to
own. Only these five were genuinely absent. Each is paired with a mechanism here or marked as not
binding; a law with no mechanism beside it is vocabulary.

| law | how it binds here |
|---|---|
| **Chesterton's Fence** — *never tear down a fence until you know why it was put up* | **THE sharpest one, and it was worked live the day it was added.** `port-audit.sh` skips `expect=ondemand` rows; a mutation test asserting the opposite failed 1-of-74 and the GUARD was blamed in writing. The fence had been put up the day before, because colima's `lima-hostagent` legitimately reparents to init and was being faulted on a healthy machine. **The mechanism that saved it: the exemption carried its reason INLINE**, so the fence explained itself in thirty seconds instead of being torn down. An exemption without its reason is a fence with no sign on it — and the next reader removes it. |
| **The 90-90 Rule** (Cargill) — *the last 10% of the code takes the other 90% of the time* | Binds hard, and the local name for it is **the last wire**. Surveying two live desks produced the same shape three times in one report: a `halt` table with a reader and no writer; a roster guard whose exit code is discarded by `\|\| true`; an overfitting guard whose refusal is swallowed by `except: pass`. Each defence was designed, built, measured — and left one wire short, while reading as covered. **The second 90% is not polish, it is connection**, which is why shipping-and-parity §1 says *build it, wire it, or delete it; never the middle state.* |
| **Brooks's Law** — *adding manpower to a late project makes it later* | **Transformed, not inherited.** Sub-agents need no onboarding, so the classical cost is absent — but the cost that replaces it is real and larger: **every agent claim must be re-anchored to the raw instrument before it can be acted on.** Measured at v1.2.0 over five agents in one session: two returned findings that were acted on directly, one *corrected a conclusion this operator had already written down*, and two returned expired timers with nothing new. The scaling limit is not communication paths, it is **verification bandwidth** — one operator can only re-derive so many claims. See the Chaitin-Kolmogorov row above: never verify one agent against another agent's summary. |
| **Kernighan's Law** — *debugging is twice as hard as writing, so code at your cleverest is undebuggable* | Binds as a **comment policy**, not a cleverness policy. The dense one-liners here are deliberate and survive because the docblock above them records what was measured, what was refuted, and what breaks if the next reader "fixes" it. The rule as applied: **you may write it at your cleverest if you also write down why** — clean-go's *document WHY, not HOW*. Where that note is missing, the cleverness is a defect regardless of whether the code is correct. |
| **Law of Triviality** (bike-shedding) — *disproportionate weight to trivial matters* | **NOT APPLICABLE in its classic form** — there is no committee here. The polarity-flipped version does bind and is worth naming: with an agent, **the trivial thing gets done instantly, which makes it tempting to keep doing trivial things.** A session can produce twenty clean cosmetic commits and never touch the unwired halt table. The counter is the ranked survey: money and data-loss first, cosmetics last, and the ranking written down BEFORE the work starts. |

**The one that should change behaviour tomorrow:** the 90-90 rule, under its local name. Every survey
of this system's own projects finds defences that are built and unconnected, and they read as coverage
from the roster. **Before building a new check, ask which existing one is one wire short.**

---


## XVI. Temporal control, trigger mechanics and self-preservation

The tier that diagnosed the loudest problem in this system: **the detectors were level-triggered.**

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Edge-triggered vs level-triggered guards** | **The diagnosis, and the fix.** Measured over one day: one check logged the same failure **eight** times and another **seven**, and not one was a new fault — a level-triggered detector re-fires for as long as the condition holds, which buries the transition in repetition and trains the reader to skim. The ledger now marks `NEW FAIL`, `still failing`, `RECOVERED`, or nothing at all. **The transition is the information; the repetition is noise.** |
| **Debounced / throttled evaluation** | The same insight applied to cost: a memoised check keyed on `path + mtime + size` skips work whose input cannot have changed — throttling by content rather than by clock. |
| **Dead man's switch (async interrupt hook)** | Every agent probe carries a budget and dies at it, and a check asserts that no agent process outlives its lock. Three were found alive 6–17 minutes past their runs; one held a port declared to another service. **A hung agent looks exactly like a working one from outside, so the timer must be external.** |
| **Jittered exponential backoff** | Partially applied: a deadline retries once at double the budget, a quota refusal never retries. **Jitter is absent** and that is honest — one operator on one machine has no thundering herd, but siblings sharing one credential are a real herd of a smaller kind. |
| **Token bucket vs leaky bucket** | The per-agent lock is a bucket of exactly one token that does not refill until released: bursts are refused, not queued, so a caller learns immediately instead of waiting. |
| **Backpressure propagation** | Locks fail closed with a distinct exit code, so an upstream caller can branch on *busy* rather than guess from a timeout. |
| **Bounded recursion / context budgeting** | Always-loaded instruction budgets are **ratchets** that only move down, metered per source, with session cost separated from per-request cost. Raising one must name what was added and why it must be read every session. |
| **Graceful degradation (load shedding)** | The healer sheds exactly the right work: it repairs what regenerates and **refuses** what needs judgement, rather than degrading into guessing at config values. |
| **Saga pattern (compensating transactions)** | Two real instances. Config application: apply → restart → read the application's own verdict → **revert on rejection**, with the compensating action defined before the forward one. And salvage-before-removal: a worktree held the only copy of a line, so the extraction was committed in its own commit *before* anything was deleted. **Never let the destructive step and the preserving step share a failure mode.** |
| **Adaptive heartbeat / dynamic cadence** | **PARTIAL.** A fixed 4-hourly schedule plus on-demand runs, with no adaptation to load. A cheap check could run per change and an expensive one back off when quiet — named as undone rather than implied. |
| **Phased duty cycling** | Checks run on a 4-hourly schedule plus on demand, not in a poll loop — the cheap ones are cheap enough to run per change, the expensive ones are scheduled. |

**Why this tier mattered most:** every other improvement made the system *more* correct. This one made it
*readable* — and an unreadable detector is a silenced one, which is the failure mode all the others feed.

---


## XVII. Overfitting, pacing, and not repeating yourself — applied to this document's own system

This tier is the sharpest criticism of the work that produced this file, so the evidence is included
rather than the definitions.

| concept | what the measurement says |
|---|---|
| **Premature generalization ("framework" trap)** | Present here: a dispatcher, a registry, a healer and a ledger were built before a second operator or a second machine existed. Defensible only because each solves a defect that actually occurred; the moment one does not, it is a framework for an audience of one. |
| **Speculative abstraction** | The honest example: a registry of paused things, complete with review dates and a validator, built for six rows. Whether that is foresight or speculation depends entirely on whether row seven ever appears. |
| **Architectural overfitting** | Twenty checks built in one day. Honest audit of prior sightings: one had **four** real instances before it existed (justified), one had **three** (justified), one had **two** (borderline), one was built on **one** condition that then fired eight times, and **two were built from a CONCEPT with zero prior defects.** That last category is the definition of the trap — a detector for a failure that had never occurred here. |
| **One-in, one-out deletion metric** | **177,609 insertions against 174 deletions in one repository in one day.** The metric says high velocity should mean *less* total code. This ratio says the opposite, and no amount of per-file justification changes the aggregate. |
| **Rule of three** | Partially honoured, and the exceptions are now named. The checks with 3–4 prior sightings earned their place; the ones with 0–1 did not, and were built because a concept was persuasive rather than because a defect recurred. |
| **YAGNI** | Violated in at least two places — and the violations are documented above rather than quietly kept. |
| **Goodhart's Law** | The clearest self-inflicted case: **"N guards passing" became a target.** A count of passing checks measures the checks, not the system. Two of them have never reported a fault on the real tree outside their own mutation tests, so the count was partly measuring my own output. |
| **Occam's razor / parsimony** | The defensible core is small: apply-and-verify-with-rollback, one declaration per fact, verify against the instrument, prevention before healing before detection. Most of the value is in those four; the rest is enforcement scaffolding around them. |
| **Regression test coupling** | **Honoured consistently.** Every check was mutation-tested against a planted defect before being trusted, and several were rewritten when the test revealed the check — or the test — was wrong. |
| **Blameless post-mortem** | Structurally enforced by writing every failure into the code that caused it: each check carries its own history of being wrong — the exact-match failure, the SIGPIPE, the roster that reported intent rather than output. **A defect recorded at the site of the defect cannot be re-litigated as someone's fault; it is just the file's history.** |
| **Five whys / root-cause analysis** | Worked, and one chain is worth keeping: a port collision → a leaked process → a probe that signalled only the parent → a package fetched per launch → a package-manager policy permitting exactly one package. **Five levels, and the fix was at the fifth.** |
| **The 15-minute rule (stop rushing)** | **Violated repeatedly.** Three tests passed on the first attempt and were wrong: a window smaller than the defect, a threshold below the planted value, a file outside the roster. Each would have been caught by pausing to ask *"could this test have failed?"* — the cheapest question available and the one most often skipped. |
| **Linter as enforcer / pre-commit** | Partially in place: checks run on a schedule and on demand, but not at edit time. Named as the next shift left, still undone. |

**The verdict this tier forces:** the system is defensible where a defect recurred and speculative where a
concept was persuasive. **Two detectors should probably be deleted, and that is the owner's call, not the
builder's** — recorded here so the question is asked rather than forgotten.

---


## XVIII. Formal foundations — and the two that change a decision here

Most of this tier is background. Two of them are directly load-bearing, and one is a formal restatement
of a rule already earned the hard way in quantitative work.

| formulation | where it binds |
|---|---|
| **Hoare triple — `{P} C {Q}`** | The config-application gate **is** a Hoare triple, and naming it that way makes the missing piece obvious. `P`: a known-accepted snapshot exists. `C`: write the candidate, restart, read the application's own loader verdict. `Q`: either the new config is accepted, or the accepted snapshot is restored. **The postcondition is what makes the operation safe to attempt** — without a guaranteed `Q`, every config edit is a gamble. Generalise it: no destructive step without a stated postcondition that holds on both branches. |
| **Kolmogorov complexity — `K(s) = min{|p| : U(p) = s}`** | **This is a formal statement of the overfitting rule.** A model that needs many parameters to describe its data has high `K` relative to the data — it is *memorising*, not compressing, and memorised noise does not generalise. It gives the discipline a precise form: **prefer the hypothesis with the shortest description that still reproduces the observation**, and treat a parameter added after seeing the outcome as part of the description length. It also bounds refactoring: code that cannot be made shorter without losing behaviour is already minimal, and further "cleanup" is churn. |
| **Master theorem — `T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)`** | The honest model for fan-out. `a` subproblems, and `f(n)` is the **combine** cost — reading, verifying and reconciling what came back. Measured here: five agents answered in parallel in minutes, but the combine step (checking each claim against the instrument) was serial and dominated. **When `f(n)` dominates, more parallelism buys nothing.** |
| **Amdahl vs Gustafson** | The serial fraction in agent work is the *human or orchestrator reading the results*. Amdahl bounds it: parallel agents cannot speed up what only one reader can verify. Gustafson's escape is real but specific — spend added capacity on **deeper verification of the same question**, not on more opinions about it. |
| **Shannon entropy — `H(X) = -Σ P(x)log₂P(x)`** | Two uses. Detecting formulaic phrasing is an entropy argument: the flagged patterns are *low-entropy* — highly predictable given the context — which is exactly why they read as machine-written. And it bounds telemetry: a ledger row carrying a verdict, a duration and a count is near the useful minimum; adding prose to it adds bytes, not information. |
| **Curry-Howard — `Programs ≅ Proofs`** | The formal reason a type system beats a runtime check, and the formal reason shell scripts cannot have one. With no compiler to carry the proof, the substitute is an assertion at every boundary that **prints what it resolved** — a proof obligation discharged at runtime and made visible, since it cannot be discharged at compile time. |
| **PACELC** | Covered above; restated formally here: with no partition, the trade is Latency vs Consistency, and a cache is that trade made explicit. |

### For quantitative work specifically

Three of these bear directly on trading analysis, where the cost of being wrong is money rather than churn:

- **Kolmogorov** formalises why a strategy with many tuned parameters fails forward: its description length is
  large relative to its sample, so it encodes noise. **Report description length alongside performance** —
  a rule needing six conditions on 14 observations has effectively memorised them.
- **Shannon** bounds how much signal a channel can carry. A market that is efficient-minus-fee at the ask
  has, by construction, little extractable information at that price; a strategy claiming otherwise is
  claiming a channel capacity the measurement does not support.
- **Master theorem / Amdahl** govern backtest cost honestly: parallelising a grid search does not reduce
  the number of hypotheses tested, and **the count of hypotheses is what inflates false positives.**
  Faster search makes overfitting cheaper to commit, not less likely.

---



## XIX. Structure, naming, tunnels and fault isolation

The tier with the highest hit rate: two items named defects still present when it was read.

| concept | mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bulkhead isolation** | **Implemented on reading this.** One check was permanently red because credential-shaped strings sit in append-only records that can only be remedied by rotation — a *pending decision*, already tracked with a deadline. Left blocking, it made the whole ledger read NOT CLEAN and hid whether anything **else** broke: one compartment flooding sinks the ship. Failures are now **blocking** or **advisory**; advisory ones still run, print and record, but do not gate. **Moving a check to advisory requires its remedy be tracked somewhere with a date — otherwise it is not advisory, it is ignored.** |
| **Sandwich architecture (imperative shell, functional core)** | **The sharpest unmet one.** Every check here mixes side effects with logic — it reads the tree, probes processes, and decides, all in one pass. That is exactly why testing one needs a temp directory and an overridden `HOME`. A pure core taking a *snapshot* and returning a verdict would be testable with plain inputs. **Named as the largest remaining structural debt.** |
| **Fail-safe defaults** | Honoured where it counts: locks **fail closed**, a resolver refuses rather than printing nothing, an unreadable authority yields no verdict instead of "nothing is wrong". One deliberate exception, stated: the credential scan excludes append-only history by default — fail-*open* on scope, because scanning what cannot be fixed makes a check permanently red. |
| **Layered guardrail architecture** | Partial: enforcement at integration (scheduled, on demand) but **not at generation**. Edit-time is the shift-left still undone. |
| **Package by feature (vertical slicing)** | Applied to knowledge: filed by the SHAPE of the lesson, not by subject. Filing by subject put 306 of 544 files in one bucket. *(measured at v1.1.0)* |
| **Single responsibility** | One check, one fault class, one exit code — and **no check may invoke another**, which is SRP stated as decoupling. |
| **Intention-revealing naming** | Uneven, honestly. `write_if_changed`, `is_advisory`, `prev_verdict` and `state-now` say what they do. Loop variables like `st` and `gen` do not, and one cost real time: naming a variable `path` in zsh **destroyed `PATH`** mid-script, because that name is already taken by the shell. **A name can collide with the language, not just with a reader's understanding.** |
| **Symmetrical naming pairs** | Weak: `--read` / `--all` are not opposites, and the apply gate has `apply` and `--verify` but no named `--revert` even though reverting is exactly what it does on failure. The behaviour is symmetrical; the vocabulary is not. |
| **Ubiquitous language** | Strong, and it is why the docblocks work: PAUSED, PHANTOM, DORMANT, FINISHED, advisory, blocking, epitaph, blind spot. Each term means one thing everywhere, so a verdict can be read without re-deriving what it meant. |
| **Encapsulation tunnels** | Each wrapper is the only door to its agent: it owns the environment, preflights the binary, then `exec`s. Nothing else launches an agent directly. |
| **Scoped execution contexts** | Working directory is passed **explicitly** to every delegated task, never inherited — which is why a task can be pointed at another project without changing global state. |
| **Secure tunneling** | **NOT APPLICABLE** — everything is local stdio or loopback. Recorded so its absence is a decision. |
| **Graceful fallbacks** | The `$0`-first ladder is a fallback chain read in the honest direction: the cheapest rung is the *default*, and a higher rung must be justified rather than merely available. |

---

## The practitioner's checklist — what to actually do

Everything above compresses to these. Each line was earned by a specific defect, not chosen for elegance.

**Before building**
1. **Can the cause be deleted?** Prevention → healing → detection, in that order. A check that never fires because the fault is impossible beats one that fires and gets repaired.
2. **Has it happened three times?** Two of the checks in this system were built from a persuasive *concept* with zero prior defects. That is the overfitting trap.
3. **Prefer the shortest description that reproduces the observation.** A parameter chosen after seeing the outcome counts toward the description length.

**While building**
4. **Read the instrument, not its documentation.** The shipped binary's symbol table, `lsof`, `ps`, `--porcelain`. Every wrong verdict in one measured day came from docs or memory; every verdict that held came from an instrument.
5. **Compare inodes before calling two files copies.** `ls` shows duplication; `stat -f %i` shows identity.
6. **An exit code is an interface; a log sentence is an accident.** Anything that branches on another program's prose will break when the prose is reworded.
7. **No destructive step without a postcondition that holds on both branches.** Snapshot, act, verify against the system's own verdict, restore on failure. Salvage before removal, in a separate commit.
8. **A generator is judged on its diff**, not its logic. Write only when content actually changed.

**While testing**
9. **When a test passes first try, check that it could have failed.** Three tests passed and were wrong in one day: a window smaller than the defect, a threshold below the planted value, a target outside the roster.
10. **Mutation-test for sensitivity AND specificity.** A check that fires on correct input gets switched off, and a switched-off check catches nothing. Declare which way the bias runs.
11. **Assert the roster is not empty.** A clean pass and an empty pass must never print the same thing.

**While operating**
12. **Mark the transition, not the repetition.** `NEW FAIL` / `still failing` / `RECOVERED` / nothing.
13. **A cascade is one fault, not N.** No detector may invoke another detector. Fix the root.
14. **Count how often each check fails.** One that fails repeatedly is reporting on its cause or on itself — never on the system.
15. **Print the count resolved and the blind spot, every run.** A number with no scope beside it is rhetoric.
16. **A repeated invocation must not repeat its side effect.** A lock prevents concurrency, not repetition.
17. **Nothing stays paused forever.** A temporary decision carries its own expiry, or it becomes permanent architecture nobody remembers choosing.

---

## X. Not doing the same work twice — the anti-repetition machinery

The tier that decides how much a change costs the *next* person. Every row below names a mechanism
that exists in this repository today; where nothing implements it, the row says so.

| concept | mechanism that implements it |
|---|---|
| **A document may not assert a present state** | "Currently", "recently", "today" and "for now" are claims a reader cannot check and an instrument cannot compare. Three were found and removed: Dependabot "currently covers GitHub Actions" (it had watched one ecosystem of three since the lock and the Go module landed), a label catalog described as "planned" while a planted defect proves it is enforced, and a topic list restated beside the declaration that owns it. **The replacement is always the same: name the version it was measured at, or name the instrument that answers it now.** |
| **A duplicate in a LIST hides where the loader cannot see it** | The strict YAML loader refuses a duplicate KEY, and a second `pip` entry for the same directory in dependabot.yml slipped past it because list items have no keys to collide. Measured here, by adding it. `check` now refuses a duplicate (ecosystem, directory) pair — a guard for the shape, not for the instance. |
| **A parser must refuse, never choose** | Every YAML read goes through a loader that REFUSES a duplicate key. PyYAML keeps the last one and reports nothing, which moved every F# file to the Forth pack on a diff that read as an addition. A tool that picks a winner where the input is ambiguous produces a confident wrong answer, which is strictly worse than an error. |
| **A transformation ends when the artifact parses** | Every tracked source file must parse, checked FIRST. A mechanical re-indent wrote a harness file that no longer compiled, twice, and the contract printed all of its counts — it validated documents and never asked whether its own code was valid. |
| **Single source of truth (DRY)** | `tools/tools.schema.json` is read by the contract, by the probe and by the skeleton generated into the authoring guide. Nothing restates it: a document that repeats the source of truth drifts from it silently, and the reader cannot tell a current copy from a stale one. |
| **One number, one declaration** | The README's generated facts and `packprobe` reported **884** and **276** declared entries for the same words — one counted positions, the other distinct entries. Neither was wrong; *having two* was, because a reader cannot tell which instrument is lying. Both now call one counting function. |
| **Memoization, and the invalidation seam it needs** | The parsed schema is cached. A mutation test that edited that schema on disk then **passed while planting nothing**, because the harness was checking bytes it already held. A cache with no explicit invalidation seam turns a planted defect invisible; `reset_caches()` is that seam, and it is called around every mutation. |
| **Content-addressable output** | A generator writes only when rendered content actually differs, so a second run leaves no diff. Judge a generator on its **diff**, never on its logic. |
| **Structured handoff (meta-prompting)** | `route --json` and `plan --json` emit a record — route, precedence rule, evidence, card, manifest, gates — so a consumer swaps one context block instead of re-deriving the router by regex over printed lines. |
| **Prompt expansion, as code rather than habit** | `atlas.py plan <path> --task debugging --change source_change` *is* the translation layer: an artifact becomes a route, a task profile, a tool set and the gates that change class requires. The enrichment is declared in `atlas.yaml` and identical every time, instead of improvised per prompt. |
| **Structural uniformity** | Every pack is `README.md` + `OPERATING.md` + `tools.yaml`, at one depth, with the canonical output paths declared in `atlas.yaml`. The contract fails on a pack missing any of the three. Uniformity is the reason one router answers for every language with no special case — and the reason an agent can predict a path it has never seen. |
| **Minimal cognitive overhead** | One door: `atlas.py route <path>` answers language, card, manifest, label, lane and gates in a single call, and says which precedence rule resolved it. An agent that reads six documents to find the seventh spends its budget on navigation. |
| **The roster is the tree, never a listing of it** | The probe walked `languages/*/tools.yaml` and silently skipped the nested `quantum/qsharp` pack — a real pack, absent from every number it printed. `rglob` is the tree; a one-level listing was a rendering of it that agreed until a pack was nested. |
| **Every limit has an owner** | `atlas.yaml/instruments` gives each instrument what it proves, what it does not, and **who closes that**. The contract fails on an empty `closed_by` and on any script the roster does not name, so a blind spot with no owner is unrepresentable rather than discouraged. A table of limits nobody owns ages into a table of defects. |
| **Shift-left verification** | The editor tasks, the devcontainer and CI run the same commands, and CI runs the **mutation tests before the contract**: a harness that cannot catch a planted defect must not be trusted to report a clean tree. |
| **Deterministic pipelines** | **PARTIAL.** Generated output is byte-identical for identical input, and every workflow declares a permission floor, a concurrency group and a timeout — but actions are pinned to a major tag, not a commit SHA. Scorecard reports it; it is named here rather than left implied. |
| **Durable checkpointing / reversible execution** | **GAP, deliberately.** Nothing here runs long enough to need a resume point: the contract is one bounded pass that is safe to re-run. If an agent loop is ever added, its state file belongs beside it and this row becomes a mechanism. |
| **Concurrency isolation (message passing over shared state)** | No concurrency ships here; the **gate** does. A `concurrency_change` requires race detection, cancellation and timeout tests, and the worked examples pass values across bounded queues with an explicit deadline rather than sharing memory. |
| **Pareto–Zipf locality** | The harness files are the hot path: linted, mutation-tested, capped at `atlascore.MAX_CODE_LINES`, split when one crossed it. The packs are documents and are held to structure only. Strictness is spent where execution happens, not spread evenly to look thorough. |
| **Minimal surface area (zero trust)** | Workflows start from `contents: read`; MCP servers activate per task profile, never globally; a symbol is private until a second module imports it. Exporting "in case" is what produced thirty unimported exports in one audit. |

---

## XI. Generation, governance and the order of work

Harvested from a proposed framework for directing AI code generation and backend construction.
Every row names what implements it here, or says plainly that nothing does.

| concept | mechanism that implements it |
|---|---|
| **Functionality first** | The build order is DECLARED in `atlas.yaml/build_order`: schema and types → state machine → integration tests → API contract → presentation, each step naming the gate class that judges it. The rule beside it is that a step may not begin until the one above it has passed. A plain CLI must be able to do everything the product can do before anything is styled. |
| **Schema-first generation** | The manifest schema existed before the manifests were rewritten to satisfy it, and the grammar REFUSES what it cannot classify. Generating logic before the schema is locked is how prose ended up in a field an instrument then had to skip. |
| **The defensive contract (explicit error types)** | Every example added at 2.2.0 returns a typed refusal rather than a partial success: Rust `Outcome::GaveUp`, Go `(error)` with `context.DeadlineExceeded`, C returning −1 rather than a truncation, and `${VAR:?}` in shell. **A truncation reported as success is the silent break.** |
| **Treat generated output as untrusted input** | `atlas_test.py` plants a defect for every rule the contract claims, CI runs the mutation tests BEFORE the contract, and `exrun.py` executes every example. Output that cannot be executed is not evidence. |
| **The ratchet (quality moves one way)** | Three of them: the context budget only moves down; the OpenSSF Scorecard floors are declared **per check** and only move up; and the dependency lock is hash-pinned, so an install either matches the recorded bytes or fails. |
| **Local fix versus global masking** | A cascade is one fault, not N — no detector may invoke another, and a fix that moves a symptom downstream is a defect with a new address. The pull-request template asks for a breakage review, not a test count. |
| **Strict aggregation (bulkheads, no leaky abstractions)** | Boundary contracts at every edge, and an aggregate is permitted only if it DECLARES itself one. The bounded-queue and worker-pool examples refuse work past their limit rather than degrading the whole run. |
| **Idempotency and transaction boundaries** | The Rust example is the worked case: the same key returns the FIRST result rather than producing a second effect, and the retry is bounded by a time budget rather than an attempt count. A lock prevents concurrency, not repetition. |
| **Fail closed** | Every workflow starts from `contents: read`; every instrument REFUSES rather than reporting when it cannot measure — `ghaudit` with no API, `packprobe` with no PyYAML, `doctor` with a missing requirement. A green line from a check that never ran is the failure this repository is built around. |
| **Licence and IP gatekeeping, automated** | `deny-licenses` on the required Dependency Review check: a copyleft dependency arriving through a transitive bump would change what the whole tree may be used for, silently, in a pull request nobody read that far into. |
| **CQRS (commands separated from queries)** | **NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE, and it would be cargo cult if it were:** this repository has no mutable store. It is named because the gate that would judge it (`api_change`) already exists, so a consuming system can adopt the split without inventing a new class of verification. |

## The ordering rule, stated once

**Prevention → healing → detection.**

1. **Can the cause be deleted?** Then do that. A check that never fires because the fault is impossible beats one that fires and gets repaired.
2. **If not, can it be healed?** Only if the thing regenerates — a cache, an index, generated output. **Never heal a decision.**
3. **Only then detect.** And a detector nobody runs is a record of what went wrong, not prevention.

**The tell that you are in the wrong tier:** count how often each check fails. If one fails repeatedly,
it is reporting on its own cause or on itself — not on the system.
