"""Where a fact may live, how it is retrieved, and the asymmetries underneath both.

WHY (2.13.0). This repository was rigorous about code and silent about KNOWLEDGE. It said nothing
about which facts belong in a model's weights, which must be retrieved, and which are only ever
true for one session — so the default applied: everything becomes a document, everything gets
embedded, and a question with an exact answer is served by similarity. The cost of that is never a
visibly wrong answer. It is a PLAUSIBLE one: a row that exists is paraphrased, a row that does not
is invented, and the two are identical in the output.

THREE DECLARATIONS, EACH CHECKED BOTH WAYS. `data_classes` says how each class is retrieved and
the way it fails. `knowledge_layers` says what each layer must NEVER hold, because the defect is
always a volatile fact in the layer that cannot be updated. `retrieval_policy` says how something
is indexed, once, so it is not re-decided per ingestion — and every `never_*` list is the half
that does the work, since each one names the default that would otherwise win.

`asymmetries` is the layer under all of it: two words that belong together and are unequal. Almost
every rule in this tree is one of them, and naming the pair makes the rule portable.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE: that an index was BUILT this way. This checks the declaration is
complete and self-consistent; a retrieval system that ignores it is caught by the retrieval_change
gate, and by a citation a reader can open.
